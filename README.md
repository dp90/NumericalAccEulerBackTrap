# NumericalAccEulerBackTrap

The notebook presents a simple investigation into the numerical accuracy of the Euler backward and trapezoidal derivation rules.
First, both schemes are coded, after which their behaviors and convergence are considered for different step sizes. The considered
case is an electric current.
